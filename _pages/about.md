I am Amirhossein Mohammadi (امیرحسین محمدی - in Farsi). Currently, I’m pursuing my master’s degree in Computer Architecture at the Sharif University of Technology under the supervision of <a href="http://sharif.ir/~koohi/index.htm">`Dr. Somayyeh Koohi`</a>.
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and <u>put </u>it in the `img/` **folder**.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right `below` your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
